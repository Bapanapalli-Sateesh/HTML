        Headings are like titles, but they are actually displayed on the page. Html provides six levels of headings, and the corresponding elements are: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. The higher the number, the less prominent the heading. H1 is the main heading and the remainings are the sub-headings.

    <h1>This is the heading level 1</h1>
    <h2>This is the heading level 2</h2>
    <h3>This is the heading level 3</h3>
    <h4>This is the heading level 4</h4>
    <h5>This is the heading level 5</h5>
    <h6>This is the heading level 6</h6>
