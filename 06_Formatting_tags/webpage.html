    <p><strong>A blockchain</strong> is a type of <mark>Digital Ledger Technology (DLT)</mark> that <del>consists</del> <ins>comprises</ins> of growing list of records, called <u><em>blocks</em></u>, that are securely linked together using cryptography.<sup><small>[1][2][3][4]</small></sup> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, <mark>a timestamp</mark>, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leafs). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the block previous to it, they effectively form <em>a chain</em> (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot altered retroactively without altering all subswquent blocks.
        <br><br>
        Blckchains are typically managed by a <strong>peer-to-peer (P2P)</strong> computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consenusa algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzanite fault tolerance.<sup>[5]</sup>

    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
        Cryptographer <b>David Chaum</b> first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation <q>Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups.</q><sup>[10]</sup> Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by <b>Stuart Haber</b> and <b>W. Scott Stornetta.</b><sup>[4][11]</sup> They wanted to implement a system wherein document <mark>timestamps</mark> could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.<sup>[4][12]</sup> Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in <i><big>The New York Times</big></i> every week since 1995.<sup>[13]</sup>
        <br> <br>
        The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as <b>Satoshi Nakamoto</b> in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a <strong>Hashcash</strong>-like method to <big>timestamp</big> blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.<sup>[4]</sup> The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the <mark><u>cryptocurrency bitcoin</u></mark>, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.<sup>[3]</sup>
        <br> <br>
        In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).<sup>[14]</sup> In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.<sup>[15]</sup>
        <br><br>
        The words <em>block</em> and <em>chain</em> were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.<sup>[16]</sup>
        <br><br>
        According to <mark>Accenture</mark>, an application of the <strong><big>diffusion of innovations</big></strong> theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters' phase.<sup>[17]</sup> Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.
        <br><br>
        In May 2018, <big>Gartner</big> found that only 1% of <abbr title="Chief Information Officer">CIOs</abbr> indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term <q>planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain</q>.<sup>[18]</sup> For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a <q>game-changer</q> for their business.<sup>[19]</sup>
