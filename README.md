# HTML
Are you willing to walkthrough the concepts of HTML5? Then, this repository is for you...     

The module is designed to help you to learn the fundamentals of HTML5 concepts. By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of HTML5 and be able to build static web pages.       



## Why we need to learn the HTML?    
HTML is the core fundamental component that we use to build the web pages. HTML is the technology behind the trillions of web pages that exist today from simple research papers to rich online shopping experiences or social media applications.    

For example, Whenever we buy a book in a web shop, that site uses HTML. When we use our web mail, again lots of HTML.    


## What is HTML?
* HTML is an acronym that stands for HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE.
* HTML was invented by TIM BERNERS LEE in 1991 and it was originally designed to provide a way for people to share information over the Internet. The main goal of HTML was the representation of documents that could be linked together.
* HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
* HTML describes the structure of a web page.
* HTML consists of a series of elements to tell the browser what content should be displayed or rendered.
* HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.


## The features provided by the HTML5 version
* Enrich semantic content by including `<header>, <nav>, <main>, <aside>, <footer>, <article>, <section> and <figure>` are added.

* Responsive Images
* Web Workers
* Form Enhancements
* Web Sockets
* Micro Data
* Cross Document Messaging


## The necessary tools to start with HTML    
* A web browser, Google is the recommended one.
* A code Editor, VS Code is the recommended one.
* Add the following extensions inside the VS Code:
     1. Live Server Extension
     2. Prettier

## Boilerplate of HTML5
     <!DOCTYPE html>   
     <html lang="en">   
     <head>   
        <meta charset="UTF-8">   
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">   
        <title>Document</title>   
     </head>    
     <body>   
         This is the space to display the content.   
     </body>   
     </html>   


## Elobarating he terms in the boilerplate     
### **What is the `<!DOCTYPE html>`**      

The first thing you should see in an HTML document is the DOCTYPE. This is just a bit of information that the browser or other engine that's looking at and processing the HTML.    

A DOCTYPE is always associated with a DTD ( Document Type Definition ). 
A DTD defines how documents of a certain type should be structured (i.e. a button can contain a span but not a div), whereas a DOCTYPE declares what DTD a document supposedly respects. 

In `<!DOCTYPE html>`, the document respects html DTD.
!DOCTYPE tells the browser that the type of the document is HTML & the keyword html represents html 5 version.    


### **What is the `<html lang="en">`**      

The html element acts as the root element of the document, representing the content of the html web page is wrapped inside the root element. Everything that is related to the web page comes under this. 

`<html lang="en">` 
‘lang’ is an attribute that specifies that we are using the English language.
html, here act as a parent & has two children i.e. head & body.   

### **What is the `<head>` element**   

The head tag contains the document's metadata i.e. all sorts of content that won’t be rendered to the user means, it contains the tags / information that is not visible to the user directly. The head tag will contain the information like metadata, style, title, links etc.   

### **What is `<title>` element**    
The title tag gives us a title for the web page and is often displayed in the title bar of the window.   

### **What is the `<script>` element**    
The script element allows us to provide either right inside the document or linking to another document some scripts or code that can make our pages more interactive.    

### **What is the `<style>` element**    
The style element allows us to provide inline styling. Styles are additional information about how to render certain content.    

### **What is `<link>` element**   
The link element can provide links to a variety of different types of resources that are related to our page. Through linking, external styling will be provided.    

### **What is the `<base>` element**    
The base element allows us to specify a base address with which all our links to other document will be based on.    

### **What is the `<meta>` element**    
Meta element allows us to provide metadata about the document that can be anything from the viewport and how it can be render or it can be keywords and information that can be used in searches or to index the poages.    


### **What is the `<body>` element**      

The body element contains the content to be displayed to the user. Everything that is visible to the user comes under the body element. So, inside the body element, there is a lot of stuff, but we can really boil it down to following:   
* Text tags
* List tags
* Link tags
* Images
* Tables
* Forms and Input tags.
