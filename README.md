# HTML
Hello, My name is Sateesh Bapanapalli. This HTML repository is a collective purpose for all the conceptual topics of HTML5 and the mini projects built using the respective concepts.     

   
HTML is the core fundamental component that we use to build the web pages. HTML is the technology behind the trillions of web pages that exist today from simple research papers to rich online shopping experiences or social media applications. For example, Whenever we buy a book in a web shop, that site uses HTML. When we use our web mail, again lots of HTML. 


# What is HTML?
* HTML stands for HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE.
* HTML was invented by TIM BERNERS LEE in 1991 and it was originally designed to provide a way for people to share information over the Internet. The main goal of HTML was the representation of documents that could be linked together.
* HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
* HTML describes the structure of a web page.
* HTML consists of a series of elements to tell the browser what content should be displayed or rendered.
* HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.

# Boilerplate of HTML5
`<!DOCTYPE html>`   
`<html lang="en">`   
`<head>`   
   `<meta charset="UTF-8">`   
   `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`   
    `<title>Document</title>`   
  `</head>`    
  `<body>`   
    This is the space to display the content.   
  `</body>`   
`</html>`   

**What is the `<!DOCTYPE html>`**   
The first thing you should see in an HTML document is the DOCTYPE. This is just a bit of information that the browser or other engine that's looking at and processing the HTML.    

A DOCTYPE is always associated with a DTD ( Document Type Definition ). 
A DTD defines how documents of a certain type should be structured (i.e. a button can contain a span but not a div), whereas a DOCTYPE declares what DTD a document supposedly respects. 

In <!DOCTYPE html>, the document respects html DTD.
!DOCTYPE tells the browser that the type of the document is HTML & the keyword html represents html 5 version.   

**What is the `<html lang="en">`**   
The html element acts as the root element of the document, representing the content of the html web page is wrapped inside the root element. Everything that is related to the web page comes under this. 

`<html lang="en">` 
‘lang’ is an attribute that specifies that we are using the English language.
html, here act as a parent & has two children i.e. head & body.   

**What is the head element**   
The head tag contains the document's metadata i.e. all sorts of content that won’t be rendered to the user means, it contains the tags / information that is not visible to the user directly. The head tag will contain the information like style, title, links etc.     

**What is the body element**    
The body element contains the content to be displayed to the user. Everything that is visible to the user comes under the body element. So, inside the body element, there is a lot of stuff, but we can really boil it down to following:   
* Text tags
* List tags
* Link tags
* Multimedia
* Tables
* Forms and Input tags.
