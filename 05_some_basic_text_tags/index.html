      <h1>Some basic html text tags</h1>
    </center>

    <h2>Center tag:</h2>

    <p>
      CENTER TAG aligns the contents to the center of the web page. It was
      deprecated from the previous versions of HTML. So we use css properties to
      align the things.
    </p>



    <!-- Paragraph text -->
    <h2>Paragraph text:</h2>
    <p>
      The &lt;p&gt; element marks all the text inside it as a distinct paragraph
      text. The content which is encapsulated with p tag, is rendered as a
      paragraph text.
    </p>



    <!-- heading text -->
    <h2>Headings:</h2>
    <p>
      Headings are like titles, but they are actually displayed on the page.
      Html provides six levels of headings, and the corresponding elements are:
      &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, and
      &lt;h6&gt;. The higher the number, the less prominent the heading. H1 is
      the main heading and the remaining are the subheadings.
    </p>

    <h1>This is the heading level 1</h1>
    <h2>This is the heading level 2</h2>
    <h3>This is the heading level 3</h3>
    <h4>This is the heading level 4</h4>
    <h5>This is the heading level 5</h5>
    <h6>This is the heading level 6</h6>



    <!-- text breaking elements : <br>, <pre>, <hr> -->

    <!-- line break tag -->
    <h2>Line break is an empty element:</h2>
    <p>
      To tell the browser that we want a hard line break, we need to use an
      explicit &lt;br&gt; element.

    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <!-- preformatted tag -->
    <h2>Preformatted tag:</h2>
    <p>
      The &lt;pre&gt; is used to show a reference text on our page. HTML
      provides PREFORMATTED tag to avoid multiple line breaks in the web page.
    </p>
    <pre>
        public class Main{
          public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println("Preformatted tag");
          }
        }
    </pre>



    <!-- horizontal rule -->
    <h2>Horizontal rule:</h2>
    <p>
      The hr element is a “horizontal rule”, which represents a thematic break.
      <br />The transition from one scene of a story into the next or between
      the end of a letter and a postscript (P.S.) are good examples of when a
      horizontal rule may be appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
      P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that soon with CSS.
    </p>



    <!-- character entities -->
    <h2>Character Entities:</h2>
    <p>
      HTML character entities are basically a set of characters (entity) used to
      represent a few characters reserved by the HTML, especially invisible
      characters or characters difficult to type out using a regular keyboard.
    </p>



    <!-- address tag -->
    <h2>Address tag:</h2>
    <p>
      The address tag is used to define contact information for the author or
      owner of a document or an article. Typically, it is displayed in italics
      and may include information such as author's name, an email address, phone
      number, or physical address & even links to particular pages.
    </p>

    <address>
      Margaritaville Island Reserve Riviera Cancun
      <br />Bahia Petempich Puerto Morelos, Mexico <br />Colonia Morelos, Mexico
      77580
    </address>



    <!-- cite tag -->
    <h2>Cite tag:</h2>
    <p>
      The cite tag in HTML is not a formatting tag; it is a semantic tag. The
      cite tag is used to define the title of a creative work, such as the title
      of a book, movie, song, or a reference to the name of a creative work or
      the name of its author.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorite book is <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite> by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

    <!-- Abbreviation text -->
    <h2>Abbreviation tag:</h2>
    <p>
      To show extra information or abbreviation of a word. It will get
      highlighted with dots automatically.
    </p>

    <abbr title="WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION">WHO</abbr>
